# NounBase: a relational token data service

A simple portable data service library to persist and access nouns by context in .NET Core in an Sqlite file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Who is this for?

.NET core developers needing a fast, lightweight, dynamic semantic entity token graph persistence and query mechanism. 
It may be useful to applications that don't know in advance the schema or model component relations but need to dynamically capture holonymic/meronymic semantic relations of labeled observations.

### Demonstration
![Example](Example.png)

Reference `Mayer.Data.Models.Concepts` and obtain the service.
```
var service = services.GetService<ITokenService>();
```

Build a token graph, starting with a null context domain collective noun, Countries, for example:
```
var countries = service.GetToken("Countries" );
```
Add individuals to the collection:
```
var country = service.GetToken("US",countries);
```
Continue to build out other noun relations in the same Collection-Individual pattern:
```
var states = service.GetToken("States", country);
var state = service.GetToken("HI", states);
var cities = service.GetToken("Cities", state);
var city = service.GetToken("Hilo", cities);
```
Subsequent context path result child enumeration with query:
```
var states = service.Get(@"Countries\US\States");
Console.WriteLine((states.Children.Where(x=>x.Token=="HI").Count()==1)? "PASS":"FAIL")
```
